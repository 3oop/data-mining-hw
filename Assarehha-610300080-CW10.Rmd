>>merge 	
an (n-1) by 2 matrix, where n is the number of observations. Row i of merge describes the merging of clusters at step i of the clustering. If a number j in the row is negative, then the single observation |j| is merged at this stage. If j is positive, then the merger is with the cluster formed at stage j of the algorithm.


```{r}
dend <- as.dendrogram(avg)

plot(dend,
  xlab = "Index of Data Points",
  ylab = "Steps",
  main = "Average-Linkage Clustering"
)
